# solarpi
Platform for every kind of project:
independent intercom, remote toy, drone, and even a new Mars rover.
# A detailed description will be available soon...

The most important assumptions of the project are:
low price of components, simplicity (hardware/software), reliability, versatility. (solar panel and battery can be smaller or larger,
but the principle of operation of the system is to be the same)

# PS. FTP server as a way of information exchange...
On the one hand, it does not make sense, but... it is cheap, simple, without the need to change the network and routers ("universal/simple platform for everyone", remember?)
and most interestingly it simulates the conditions of the real world, (network latency, data exchange errors) not a laboratory. (a perfect point-to-point connection)
